# RKEDA
This is a python implementation of the RK-EDA for solving different permutation problems (i.e. TSP, LOP, QAP and PFSP).

The implementation can be adapted for solving any permutation problem by passing in the objective function in Algorithm.run_algorithm

Examples of how to run the RK-EDA are presented in SolveQAP.py and SolvePFSP.py

The algorithm is sensitive to sigma. See the following papers for more details:
