# RKEDA
This is a python implementation of the RK-EDA for solving the QAP

The implementation can be adapted for solving any permutation problem by passing in the objective function in Algorithm.run_algorithm


An example of how to run the RK-EDA is presented in SolveQAP.py


The algorithm is sensitive to sigma. See the following papers for more details
